# Security Review: Student Settings Page - OnluyenVatLy

## Executive Summary
This security review examines the implementation of the student settings page functionality in the OnluyenVatLy project, focusing on the security requirements outlined in the student-settings-page-plan.md.

## 1. Password Change Security

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **Current Password Verification** ✓
   - `authController.changePassword` requires `currentPassword` parameter
   - `authService.changeStudentPassword` verifies current password using bcrypt.compare()
   - Proper error handling for incorrect current password

2. **Minimum Password Length** ✓
   - Backend validation: 8 characters minimum enforced in `authController.changePassword`
   - Frontend validation: 8 characters minimum checked in `settings.js`
   - Password strength indicator implemented with comprehensive checks

3. **Password Hashing** ✓
   - Using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds for secure password hashing
   - Passwords are never stored in plain text

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
1. **Rate Limiting on Password Change**
   - The `/api/auth/change-password` endpoint does NOT have rate limiting applied
   - Only login endpoints have `authRateLimit` middleware
   - **VULNERABILITY**: Users can attempt unlimited password changes

2. **Session Invalidation After Password Change**
   - Password change does NOT invalidate other sessions
   - **VULNERABILITY**: If account is compromised, changing password doesn't log out attacker

## 2. Device Management Security

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **Device Validation** ✓
   - Device fingerprinting implemented
   - Devices tracked in database with IP and user agent
   - Current device cannot be unbound (protection against self-lockout)

2. **Session Cleanup on Device Removal** ✓
   - `removeDevice` method properly deletes sessions associated with removed device
   - Uses parameterized query to prevent SQL injection

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
1. **Device Fingerprinting Weakness**
   - Only using user agent and IP for device identification
   - No canvas fingerprinting or more robust device identification
   - Easy to spoof device identity

## 3. Session Security

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **Logout from All Devices** ✓
   - `logoutAllDevices` endpoint implemented
   - Properly clears all sessions for the student
   - Current session is also destroyed

2. **Session Configuration** ✓
   - httpOnly cookies enabled
   - sameSite: 'lax' for CSRF protection
   - Secure cookies in production
   - Session timeout configurable via environment

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
1. **No CSRF Token Implementation**
   - While sameSite cookies provide some protection, no explicit CSRF tokens
   - **VULNERABILITY**: Potential CSRF attacks on state-changing operations

## 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **Backend Validation** ✓
   - Comprehensive validation middleware for various input types
   - Phone number, password, name validation implemented
   - Proper error messages returned

2. **Frontend Validation** ✓
   - Client-side validation for all form inputs
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Password strength checking

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
1. **XSS Prevention**
   - No explicit HTML sanitization in settings updates
   - User bio and other text fields could contain malicious scripts
   - **VULNERABILITY**: Potential XSS through user-generated content

2. **SQL Injection Protection**
   - Using Supabase client which provides parameterized queries
   - However, some direct query construction in `settingsController`
   - Need to ensure all queries are properly parameterized

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **Authentication Middleware** ✓
   - `requireStudentAuth` properly checks student authentication
   - Session validation implemented
   - Admin access properly separated

2. **Error Handling** ✓
   - Using `asyncHandler` for proper async error handling
   - Comprehensive error types and messages
   - Proper HTTP status codes

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
1. **Missing Rate Limiting on Sensitive Endpoints**
   - No rate limiting on:
     - `/api/settings/student/privacy`
     - `/api/students/devices/:deviceId`
     - `/api/students/delete-request`
   - **VULNERABILITY**: Potential abuse of these endpoints

## 6. File Upload Security

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **File Type Validation** ✓
   - Only image files accepted for avatar upload
   - MIME type checking implemented

2. **File Size Limits** ✓
   - 5MB limit enforced for avatar uploads
   - Proper error handling for oversized files

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
1. **File Content Validation**
   - Only checking MIME type, not actual file content
   - **VULNERABILITY**: Malicious files could be uploaded with image MIME types

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Summary

### High Priority:
1. **Missing Rate Limiting** - Password change and other sensitive endpoints lack rate limiting
2. **No CSRF Token Implementation** - Relying only on sameSite cookies
3. **XSS Risk** - No HTML sanitization for user-generated content
4. **Session Management** - Password change doesn't invalidate other sessions

### Medium Priority:
1. **Weak Device Fingerprinting** - Easy to spoof device identity
2. **File Upload Validation** - Only MIME type checking, not content validation

### Low Priority:
1. **Missing Security Headers** - No explicit security headers configuration
2. **Logging Sensitive Data** - Some console.logs might expose sensitive information

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Add Rate Limiting to All Auth Endpoints**
   ```javascript
   router.post('/change-password',
     authRateLimit,  // ADD THIS
     requireStudentAuth,
     logAuthEvent('password_change_attempt'),
     authController.changePassword
   );
   ```

2. **Invalidate All Sessions on Password Change**
   ```javascript
   // In authService.changeStudentPassword, after successful password update:
   await sessionService.clearStudentSessions(studentId);
   ```

3. **Implement HTML Sanitization**
   - Use a library like DOMPurify or sanitize-html for user input
   - Sanitize bio, school name, and other text fields

4. **Add CSRF Token Implementation**
   - Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
   - Use a library like csurf for Express

### Additional Security Enhancements:
1. **Enhance Device Fingerprinting**
   - Add canvas fingerprinting
   - Include screen resolution, timezone, and other device characteristics

2. **Implement Content Security Policy**
   - Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
   - Configure appropriate security headers

3. **Add File Content Validation**
   - Use libraries like file-type to validate actual file content
   - Implement virus scanning for uploaded files

4. **Security Audit Logging**
   - Log all security-relevant events (password changes, device changes, etc.)
   - Implement proper log rotation and retention

## Conclusion

The student settings page has a solid foundation with proper authentication, password hashing, and basic input validation. However, several critical security vulnerabilities need immediate attention, particularly around rate limiting, CSRF protection, and XSS prevention. Implementing the recommended fixes will significantly improve the security posture of the application.
