- TypeScript support with proper typing

### 5. ✅ Optimize images with Next.js Image component

**Created optimized image components:**

**`frontend/src/components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx`:**
- **OptimizedImage**: Main component with automatic optimization
- **LessonImage**: Specialized for lesson images with fallbacks
- **LessonHandoutImage**: For lesson handout materials
- **AvatarImage**: For user profile images with initials fallback

**Features:**
- Automatic Next.js Image optimization for local assets
- Fallback handling for base64 and external images
- Loading states with spinners
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Responsive image sizing
- Click handlers for zoom/modal functionality

**`frontend/src/components/ui/AudioPlayer.tsx`:**
- **AudioPlayer**: Full-featured audio player with controls
- **QuizAudioManager**: Specialized for quiz game audio
- **AudioButton**: Simple button for one-off sounds

**Features:**
- Custom audio controls with play/pause/volume
- Quiz game audio management
- Preloading for instant playback
- Volume control and muting
- Integration with asset utilities

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 4

The static assets are now fully converted and optimized for Next.js. The foundation provides:

1. **Optimized Asset Loading** - Next.js Image component with automatic optimization
2. **Comprehensive Audio System** - Quiz game audio management with preloading
3. **Reusable Components** - OptimizedImage, AudioPlayer, and specialized variants
4. **Developer Tools** - Asset utilities and TypeScript support
5. **Performance Benefits** - Lazy loading, responsive images, and audio preloading

## 🧪 Usage Examples

### Image Components
```tsx
// Lesson image with automatic optimization
<LessonImage lessonId={1} alt="Physics lesson 1" />

// Handout image with click handler
<LessonHandoutImage 
  lessonNumber={5} 
  alt="Lesson 5 handout"
  onClick={() => openHandoutViewer()} 
/>

// Avatar with fallback
<AvatarImage 
  src="/images/user.jpg" 
  alt="User Name" 
  fallbackInitials="UN" 
/>
```

### Audio Components
```tsx
// Quiz audio manager
<QuizAudioManager onAudioReady={() => console.log('Ready')} />

// Simple audio button
<AudioButton audioType="correct" variant="sound1">
  Play Correct Sound
</AudioButton>
```

## 📋 Migration Guide

The new components provide drop-in replacements for HTML img and audio tags:

- `<img>` → `<OptimizedImage>`
- `<audio>` → `<AudioPlayer>`
- Quiz audio → `<QuizAudioManager>`

All asset paths are automatically resolved for Next.js public folder structure.

Phase 3 is complete and the application is ready for page conversion in Phase 4!
