## 🎨 Design System Analysis

### Current Visual Theme
- **Design Philosophy**: Modern Gen Z dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: `#0a0a0f` (near black background)
  - Secondary: `#1a1a2e` (dark blue-gray)
  - Gradients: Purple to violet (`#667eea → #764ba2`)
  - Neon accents: `#a855f7` (purple), `#ec4899` (pink), `#3b82f6` (blue)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with gradient text effects
- **Effects**: Glassmorphism cards, smooth animations, backdrop blur
- **Components**: Pill-shaped buttons, glass-background inputs, hover animations

### UI Patterns to Follow
- Glass cards with blur effects and subtle borders
- Gradient backgrounds for primary actions
- Smooth transitions (0.2s-0.5s cubic-bezier)
- Responsive grid layouts with consistent spacing
- Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly elements

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New settings table
CREATE TABLE student_settings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER REFERENCES students(id),
    settings_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add settings columns to existing students table
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN avatar_url VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN grade_level VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN school_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN bio TEXT;
```

### 2. API Endpoints
```javascript
// New settings endpoints
GET /api/settings/student/:id          // Get student settings
PUT /api/settings/student/:id          // Update student settings
POST /api/settings/student/:id/avatar  // Upload avatar
DELETE /api/settings/student/:id/avatar // Delete avatar

// Enhanced existing endpoints
PUT /api/students/:id/profile          // Update profile (enhanced)
POST /api/auth/change-password         // Change password (complete)
GET /api/students/:id/devices          // Get bound devices
